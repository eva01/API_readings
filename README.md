Web Scraper for Malaysian API and Singapore PSI readings

Unfortunately, Malaysia no longer works. So we only have Singapore data from Oct-2015 onwards. Don't look at me--the DOE has removed all historical data from their site.

All data stored in the nice db file under the /data folder of the repo.

The latest version no longer requires MYSQL, it'll now work with SQLite, a much smaller and fit-for-purpose DB.
